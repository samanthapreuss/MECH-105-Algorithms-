# MECH-105-Algorithms-
This repository contains all the algorithms I have created for a numerical methods course, **MECH 105**, that I took my freshman year as a mechanical engineering student at Colorado State University.  

## Contains
1. Binary Convertor
2. False Position: Root Finding Method
3. LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting
